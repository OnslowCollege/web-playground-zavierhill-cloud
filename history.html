<h1>ROBLOX History</h1>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<div class="section">

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Early Days (2009)</h2>
        <p>In 2009 Roblox added technical updates, like the introduction of the group feature, gears, more textures, and 64 types of character colors. Roblox added these things to keep the players happy and to  increase the bulding and the customisation. Roblox also "accidentally" released admin privileges to all players. Can't imagine how that went. :-)</p>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Growth Era (2010-2016)</h2>
        <p>As the 2010s went by, Roblox began to partner with various sponsored events, including partnerships with Minions, The Good Dinosaur, and Disney XD. Roblox did this because they saw the potential to grow their younger audience base, and also profit from the sponsors. If that wasn't enough, in early 2016 Roblox was added to the XBOX 1, Microsoft Store, and the Oculus Rift!</p>

    <img src="2015%20roblox%20history.jpg">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Modern Roblox (2017-2025)</h2>
        <p>By 2017 Roblox had reached many milestones, one of which was setting a new player record of 272M users on the platform! The following year after that in 2018 Roblox had its first game hit 1 billion visits.That game being Meepcity. Then much later in 2021 Roblox had the longest outage being a whooping 72 hours and 45 minutes. After this happend the roblox players were fuming, the developers were freaking out, and the roblox employees were panicking as the stock market dropped by 3% and they lost 1.66B from the companys market value. They shortly recovered afterwards. </p>
